### [From Propeller to Jet: Changing your engines mid flight](https://www.confluent.io/kafka-summit-sf18/from-propeller-to-jet)

> Kafka Summit SF - Oct 16-17th 2018

Don’t you love signing in to your favorite application only to find out it’s undergoing scheduled maintenance? I know I don’t! 
Designing scalable systems is a challenge all software engineers face. Ultimately this means you will find yourself in a situation
where you need to upgrade your software engines for better performance. In this session, I will guide you through the experience of swapping out PagerDuty’s original prop engine consisting of a Cassandra
queue-based system to that of a 747 which utilizes Kafka not only for ingestion of customer data but also internal heuristics and
back pressure support.
